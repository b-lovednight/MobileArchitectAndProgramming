The Event Tracking Application required a login page that would serve both as an authentication and registration page such that new users can create an account and sign in.  The application did not have to create a separate file or save location for the logins.  The Main Activity of the Application was to store, view, edit and create new events.  The Event Name, Date, Owner, and Invitees was to be shown on the event page.  

A login screen, main activity screen, and SMS screen were required for this project.  Unfortuantely the project was submitted incomplete and does not have a completed SMS page.  

Iterative coding approaches were used along with terminal output debugging to understand where any data structures were either failing or parsing incorrect information.  Furthermore versioning was a critical part of the process as the requirements changed from having static elements on the XML file to dynamic recycled elements. 

Code was run on a virtual device emulator to ensure that everything was working.  The login page was tested multiple times and new accounts created. 

A challenge that was overcome was creating the SQL commands to entering new information into the LoginDatabase.java database.  Understanding that the spacing and casing is crucial with SQL commands is very valuable knowledge for the future. 

Creating the database object, methods, and closing the database when needed were the specific components that I found the most challenging and rewarding aspect to learn.
